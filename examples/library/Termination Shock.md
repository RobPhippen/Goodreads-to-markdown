### Review
**Up close and personal with climate change and geoengineering!**

This book is at times thrilling, scary and hilarious. The author deploys some exquisitely honed English to poke fun at even the most serious moments. Every character is given chance to breath, emote, and very much come to life. Two main plot lines come together at the end in a fabulous, near-future wild western showdown.
